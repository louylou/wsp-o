<section><!--Site Intent-->
	
	<h2>Site Intent:</h2>
	
	   <p>Where to begin when it comes to re-designing OCCS? This website is a mess in every aspect.
	   My goal for this website is to start with consolidating it's 18 pages into 6, laconic and insightful pages.
	   These 6 pages will be named, Home, Cleaning, Washing, Specials, Appointments, and Equipment. 
	   Also, I plan on changing the whole face of the website. It is lacking in aesthetics, organization and interest.
	   Further, the HTML and CSS files have a numerous amount of errors, these files will be updated to HTML5 and CSS3 elements.
	   Lastly, I will arrange and correct the OCCS's information to make it deliberately for its targeted audience. 
	   This will make it easy to find and understand, which will satisfy the user. In the end,
	   OCCS will be a desirable and informative website.</p>

</section><!--Competitive Analysis--> 

   <h2>Competitive Analysis:</h2>
<p>OCCS is not a very popular website based off of its cluttered pages and lack of organization. Users feel overwhelmed when looking for 
a particular fact about the company. This is one reason why OCCS is losing to its competition. There are many more carpet cleaning services in the Orlando area that provide 
better service and friendlier websites. OCCS's website statistics  are:</p>   
<ul class="comp_list">
<li><strong>Global Rank:</strong> 9,591,266.</li>

</ul>
	
	<h2>Competitor Information:</h2>
	<p>The 3 highest competitors to OCCS are ServPro, Sears Clean and ChemDry. These companies have the advantage when it comes
	to getting residential and commercial business because their websites are much more organized, informative and easier to search. Even though they
	are not ranked very well, it shows users rather use websites that are more organized and professional as compared to OCCS.</p>

	</ul>
</div>

<div class="clear_p">

	<p>Just with knowing these few facts can show that OCCS needs improvement. OCCS lacks in keeping the users interest to stay on their website from 
	too large of fonts, harsh colors, lengthly, and unorganized information. All of these elements can and will be re-design, which will drastically help OCCS global and US rank.
