<h1>Products/Chemicals…</h1>

<p>
 At OCCS we use over 75 different bio-degradeable cleaning chemicals. OCCS uses only the best quality, environmentally friendly, most effective, and powerful products available on the commercial market today. At OCCS we believe in using the right chemicals to meet each clients individual cleaning needs.

OCCS uses only 3M Advanced Scotchgard™ fabric and carpet protector. 
3M Advanced Scotchgard™ keeps your home cleaner, fresher, brighter... longer. 3M Scotchgard™ helps protect against both oil and water based stains, helps carpet fibers resist soiling, helps spills blot up before they become stains, helps stains release more easily when carpet and upholstery is cleaned, and helps carpet and upholstery stay cleaner longer. 3M Advanced Scotchgard™ is effective against fruit drinks, soft drinks, and frozen fruit treats. Vacuuming is more effective when 3M Advanced Scotchgard™ is applied. Dirt is more easily picked-up and fewer passes are required with the vacuum. 3M Advanced Scotchgard™ protector helps keep spills from becoming hard-to-remove spots or stains. 3M Scotchgard™ repels liquids so spills can be blotted up quickly and easily. The best time to apply Scotchgard™ protector is right after cleaning. OCCS's professional applicator can do it for you. Regular vacuuming and prompt cleanup of spills will help maintain the bright, freshly cleaned look for a long time.

<h1>Testimonials…</h1>

<p>1.) To: Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services
Your technicians just came and cleaned my carpet and
worked on sour milk odor in my fiancé’s car. Unbelievable Professionalism, knowledgeable, explained everything they were doing, told me about the equipment and for the first time ever in having my carpets cleaned, I gave both technicians a tip.  I have never had service like that, and I rarely take the time to acknowledge service unless it is exceptional and that is what I received.  Thanks for coming to Orlando. You have earned my business for a long long time!!!

Excellent job! I was afraid the walkways around the elevators weren't going to come clean. Your Powerfull Carpet Cleaning process did the trick. Now we won't have to replace our carpets nearly as soon as we thought we were going to have to. All the tile and grout in the cafeteria looks like brand new. Better yet, my secretary was confortable interacting with your staff. You really run a class act at OCCS.Thanks again!

<p>3.)To: Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services

We would like to thank you for a job well done. Your company and the carpet cleaner you used made all our hallways look almost new again. Our white couches, we thought we would have to throw out, look like the day they were delivered. No one could tell those ink stains were even there. Rest easy in knowing you have gained a customer for life.
